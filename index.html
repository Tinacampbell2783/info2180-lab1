        <h2> Tina Campbell</h2>
        <p>I’m a second-year Information Technology student who loves creating and designing things that are visually appealing. I enjoy anything creative and artistic, so web development feels like the perfect way to mix art and technology. I’m learning it not only for a possible career but also to explore a different side of computing and broaden my horizons. I think technology is amazing because of how easy, fast, and convenient it makes everyday life.</p>
